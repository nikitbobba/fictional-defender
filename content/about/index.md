**tl;dr: I'm learning the ins and outs of Artificial Intelligence in case Skynet ever becomes a reality.**

I am a rising junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for artificial intelligence and game design. I am interested in learning more about logical reasoning, perception, and Game AI to expand the possibilities of creative storytelling through gaming.
